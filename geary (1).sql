I’m very excited for this opportunity to teach these skills as a tool to quiet the mind, mend the brain, and soothe the soul.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider these seven reasons why knitting and crocheting can help you with your anxiety:</p><h3>Hand movements</h3><p>Bilateral, coordinated, precise hand movements are hard work for the brain, and crossing over midline requires even more brainwork. As a result, we are less able to pay attention to other issues and concerns. In other words, knitting “distracts” the brain.</p><h3>Repetitive movement</h3><p>Many of us use repetitive, rhythmic movement like pacing, rocking, tapping, picking, hair pulling, smoking, drinking, or eating, to calm ourselves when we are stressed or traumatized. &nbsp;There are many, many stories of people who have replaced an anxiety crutch with knitting or crochet. &nbsp;Knitters with PTSD report they have fewer flashbacks and other symptoms.</p><h3>Safety bubble</h3><p>Holding the hands together in front of the body creates the sensation of having a protective “bubble” of personal space and comfort&nbsp;and is especially helpful in threatening or anxiety-producing situations.</p><h3>Eye contact is optional</h3><p>It’s totally acceptable in knitting groups to make eye contact only when you choose to. &nbsp;Same thing with conversation, although greeting others upon arrival, and saying goodbye when you leave, is recommended. Knitting groups are safe places where conversations about knitting often lead to other topics: and choosing whether or not to participate means that you are in control.</p><h3>Portability</h3><p>Knitting and crochet can go almost anywhere with you! &nbsp;Just tuck it into a pocket, purse, or tote, and a solution is always nearby for when symptoms of anxiety and panic arise. Even visualizing the movements and feelings of knitting can help in most situations.

Learn why knitting hurts your hands, and what to do about knitting hand pain.</p><p>Unfortunately, knitting hand pain is a common occurrence for many a knitter.&nbsp; As much as we love to knit, our hands often get tired of knitting, or worse, begin to feel stiff and achy.</p><p>I have had problems with knitting hand pain in the past as well, and these tips have helped me so much!&nbsp; By implementing these methods and techniques, I can now knit for longer periods of time without the stiffness and fatigue I used to experience.</p><p>I hope you will find these tips super-helpful on your journey to more ergonomic knitting!&nbsp; But first, take a look at why knitting can cause hand pain, so we can better understand what to do about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Can knitting cause hand pain?</h3><p>Yes!&nbsp; Knitting uses a lot of small, repetitive motions to make the stitches.&nbsp; Doing these motions over and over and over again can make the hands and wrists tired, stiff, and achy.&nbsp; If you are heavily using your fingers and / or thumbs as you knit, the fingers and thumbs may hurt as well.&nbsp; Since knitting involves more than just our hands, it can also cause or contribute to pain in the upper back, shoulders, or elbows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why do my hands hurt when I knit?</h3><p>If your hands ache or tire from knitting, this can be the result of several issues.&nbsp; For one, the small, repetitive motions can fatigue the hands and wrists.&nbsp; In fact, too much repetitive motion can cause permanent damage, called repetitive strain injury.&nbsp; Carpal tunnel is one of many types of repetitive strain injury.</p><p>If you damage or injure your hands and wrists too much, you may have to stop knitting altogether!&nbsp; This is why it is so important to minimize the amount of motion required to make our stitches, so we can avoid doing damage to our hands and wrists.</p><p>Hand pain can also be caused by other conditions in the hands and wrists.&nbsp; <strong>Please Note:</strong> If you are having problems with hand or wrist injury, or if you have a painful condition in your hands, please consult your doctor. These tips in this article are not intended to treat or cure any injury or condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tips for Ergonomic Knitting</h2><p>Each time you sit down to knit, there are several important things you will want to take note of first.&nbsp; These tips may seem simple, but they are an essential foundation for comfortable, ergonomic knitting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Posture is critical</h3><p>Good posture is critical for ergonomic knitting, so be sure that the chair you sit in while knitting is a comfortable one. You want to sit up straight or lean into the back of the chair comfortably, without slouching or bending your neck forward too far.</p><p>Your shoulders should be relaxed, with your elbows at your sides.</p><p>If your chair has arm rests, make sure they are not too high or too wide. If resting your arms on the arm rest causes you to have to raise your shoulders or move your elbows too far away from your sides, it is better to not use the arm rests.</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/resize=width:1000/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/JYS3NU6RsSwYsmdeQtFf\" alt=\"drawing of a woman sitting in a chair with arms at sides, drawing of a woman sitting in a chair with wide armrests\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>This is not a marathon</h3><p>While it may be tempting to knit for several hours straight, that may not be good for your hands. I recommend knitting in a few smaller sessions throughout the day.&nbsp; You will also want to warm up your hands before beginning, by gently stretching the hands and wrists.</p><p>If you must knit for several hours at once, do not forget to take breaks! It is important to give your hands a break now and then, even if only for 5 or 10 minutes. Stretching your hands during breaks can also help relax your hands between knitting sessions.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Helpful Tools for Ergonomic Knitting</h3><h4>Ergonomic Seat Cushions</h4><p>An ergonomic seat cushion can greatly improve the comfort of your knitting chair and help with your posture. There are lots of good options available <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2kZ9Cjh\">on Amazon</a>.</p><h4>Compression Gloves</h4><p>A good pair of compression gloves can help improve circulation and support your hands. I prefer the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2mhpb5P\">completely finger-less compression gloves</a> for knitting, as I like to be able to feel the yarn running through my fingers.</p><p>However, I also have <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2kDHaTP\">longer finger-less compression gloves</a> that only have the fingertips cut off. Those may work better for you if you like more support.</p><p>I do not wear my compression gloves on video, to make it easier to see my knitting motions on camera. But I assure you that I almost always wear them to knit when I am not recording a video. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/svg/1f609.svg\" alt=\"😉\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Knit on Circular Knitting Needles, Even When Working Back &amp; Forth</h3><p>With larger projects, the fabric can get heavy as it increases in length.&nbsp; The weight of the project can add to the strain on your hands and wrists, pulling down as you are knitting.&nbsp; If you are using straight knitting needles, the weight of your project is hanging from the shafts of the needles.&nbsp; However, with circular knitting needles, the majority of the project is hanging from a flexible cable, which allows the project to rest in your lap without weighing your hands down.&nbsp; These are <a href=\"https://shrsl.com/1zij2\">my favorite circular knitting needles</a>, and I use them for almost every knitting project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Should I buy Ergonomic Knitting Needles?</h4><p>Knitting needles that are square-shaped instead of round are sometimes claimed to be more ergonomic.&nbsp; While it may be easier for some knitters to grasp a square needle, switching to square needles is not a cure-all for ergonomic knitting.&nbsp; I would suggest implementing some of the tips in this article to improve your ergonomics as well.&nbsp; If you are looking for a good set of square knitting needles, <a href=\"https://yayforyarn.com/knit-picks-options-short-interchangeable-foursquare-majestic-circular-knitting-needle-review/\">I recommend these</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Best Ergonomic Position for Knitting</h3><p>When you hold your knitting needles, it is important to make sure you don not grasp them too tightly.&nbsp; A tight grip tightens your hands as well, which can contribute to hand pain and fatigue.&nbsp; &nbsp;You want to use a light, gentle grasp to hold your needles, and make your stitches with small, delicate motions.</p>', 'https://yayforyarn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ergonomic-Knitting-Tips-cover-1024x576.png', 1, 1, 1, 9),
(18, 7, '2022-04-11 01:06:29', 'Knitting Versus Crocheting: What is the Difference and Which Should You Learn?', '<p>Depending on your skills, you may be better suited to learn the tools and method of one over the other.</p><p>Some of us enjoy knitting, while others prefer crocheting. Both techniques of needlework use <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1108119/choosing-knitting-yarn\">yarn</a> to create beautiful pieces—garments, accessories like hats and mittens, blankets—that adorn our homes or fill our closets. The beauty of both is that you can really connect with the yarn and the pattern for the project, and the end result is truly a personalized labor of love. The meditative act of stitching in repetition is one that tends to be <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1530011/crocheting-improve-memory-concentration-and-calm\">very relaxing and mentally stimulating</a>, too.</p><p>One of the questions you might ask yourself is whether to learn <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/854324/how-knit\">how to knit</a> or how to crochet, and is there much of a difference between the two? As a beginner, you can choose either one. The techniques and tools are different from one another, but both of them require practice in order to excel in skill; and to the untrained eye, the end results can appear to be very similar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Knitting Tools and Techniques</h2><p>Knitting uses a pair of long needles to form the stitches. There are different types of needles: straight, <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1535934/circular-knitting-needles\">circular</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1535871/double-pointed-knitting-needles\">double-pointed</a>.&nbsp;Needles are categorized by size as determined by the diameter of the tool and the type of stitch that you can do with them. For example, larger needles are perfect for making the large loop stitches you want for certain projects like <a href=\"http://www.marthastewart.com/854876/gingham-knit-blanket-how\">a knit blanket</a>, whereas you would want smaller needles for making baby accessories like socks and beanies. On straight needles, you can make flat pieces with a back-and-forth stitching movement. Circular needles let you knit in a circular motion, ideal for projects like cowl scarves and hats. As you progress in projects, you will find that having one size of each needle is not necessarily sufficient in knitting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You also have a few options for technique: English knitting, German/Continental knitting, or the specialty <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1536685/lever-knitting-method-explained\">lever knitting</a>. In knitting, the V-shaped stitches of your work hang off the needle and are transferred from one needle to the other, loop by loop. Starting and stopping <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1105812/easy-knitting-patterns\">your knit project</a> in the middle of progress means that stitches could be left on both needles making it slightly unwieldy. And keeping <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1536289/knitting-stitches\">the knit stitches</a> from falling off both needles in transit will require needle stoppers. It also means, you may be required to offload your work onto stitch holders while another piece gets knit on the same pair of needles.</p><h2>Crochet Tools and Techniques</h2><p>Crochet requires the use of a hook, which comes in a range of sizes. You make loops with the hook to create the essential <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1541992/crochet-stitches\">crochet stitches</a> such as the <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1541975/how-to-single-crochet-stitch\">single</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1541978/how-to-double-crochet-stitch\">double</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1541979/how-to-treble-crochet-stitch\">treble</a> stitch. The initial loop is a slip knot that is followed by a chain. Unlike knitting, crochet stitches resemble a chain of small knots. You can create several slip knots and chains for your project, but should try to keep an even tension as you work through each stitch.</p><p>You choose the size of the hook based on the size of the stitch needed, and it is a good idea to consider <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1108119/choosing-knitting-yarn\">the weight of the yarn</a> for your project, too. A small hook will not work very well with <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1536523/how-to-find-substitute-discontinued-yarn\">a yarn that has a higher weight</a>. For example, you should use a B/1 toE/4-sized&nbsp; hook when working with superfine yarn weights to create delicate items like baby clothes. But you would want a Q hook to crochet larger afghans, sweaters, and rugs with jumbo weight yarn. Oftentimes, one basic set of hooks will be enough to most of your crochet projects. You can have multiple projects going that require the same hook without having to worry about the project size, holding stitches, or if you are crocheting regular or in the round. In crochet, the stitches are simply looped onto the piece so there is no transferring of stitches from one tool to another.</p><h2>Which Should You Choose to Learn?</h2><p>Both are really <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1526670/knitting-can-reduce-depression-anxiety-and-chronic-pain\">methods of stitching yarn</a> together, just in different styles. In knitting, the stitches form a V shape. In crochet, the stitches are more like knots. Knitting uses a pair of long needles to form the loops, moving a set of loops from one needle to another; the stitches are held on the needle. Crochet uses a single hook to hook the loops together directly on the piece. It is this major difference that makes crochet much easier to work with than knitting.</p><p>For beginners who seek convenience and versatility, we suggest <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1530011/crocheting-improve-memory-concentration-and-calm\">crochet</a>. The tools and techniques are minimized, and, therefore, slightly more accessible. It is very easy to pick up as a self-taught hobby. For those looking to master a wider range of tools, then consider knitting. <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1540875/reasons-every-child-should-learn-how-knit\">Children who learn how to knit</a> from an early age can develop more complicated skills. The great benefit of knitting is that, it supports sophisticated designs in intermediate to advanced stages. Some projects combine techniques—such as our <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1042232/snuggly-shawl\">shawl in stockinette stitch and embellished with a crochet trim</a>. And you could always consider <a href=\"https://www.marthastewart.com/1542183/tunisian-crochet-method-explained\">Tunisian crochet</a>, which many consider to be the best of both techniques.</p>', 'https://doublecrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Knitting-vs-Crochet-flat.jpg', 1, 1, 1, 80),

When looking for a yarn to learn crochet with, look for these features:</p><ul><li><strong>Worsted (category 4) or bulky (category 5). </strong>These yarns make it much easier to handle the yarn and see your stitches. Since you can see your stitches without holding the fabric too close to your face, you’re more likely to be relaxed and focused.</li><li><strong>Smooth, plied yarn. </strong>Look for a yarn with a smooth texture throughout. You should be able to easily identify the individual strands. A plied yarn means that a single strand consists of several strands twisted together (often between 2-12 individual strands “plied” together). Plied yarn means you’ll have better stitch definition, thus being able to see your stitches better.</li><li><strong>Gentle, solid color. </strong>By gentle color, I mean anything that is easy on the eyes. My students typically go for pastels, especially sage green or lilac, or neutrals like tan or medium gray. Also, be sure to choose a color that is solid throughout the skein. Choosing a gentle, solid color allows you to focus on your stitching and not on how hard it is to see and understand your crochet fabric.</li><li><strong>Inexpensive.</strong> The beginning stages of crochet involve a lot of trial and error. That means you’ll likely unravel and re-crochet the same yarn over and over again. Go for an inexpensive yarn when learning so you don’t feel bad about the beating that yarn might take. Once you get the hang of things, it’ll be easy to transition to pricier yarn.</li></ul><p>Notice that I did not mention yarn fiber in this list. If you’re able to find a yarn that meets all of the criteria mentioned above, it doesn’t really matter what the fiber is. Go with your preference between animal fibers, plant fibers, and acrylic fibers.</p><h2>8 yarns for crochet beginners</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for, here are some recommendations of yarns that work well for crochet beginners.</p><h4>1.

Disadvantages: can be irritating to the skin, cost prohibitive, special care instructions, tough to find in big box stores.</li><li><strong>Plant fibers</strong> – cotton, bamboo, linen, etc. Benefits: moisture-wicking, breathable, sustainable. Disadvantages: heavier fibers, inelastic, color can fade.</li><li><strong>Synthetic fibers </strong>– acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. Benefits: affordable, accessible, easy-care. Disadvantages: environmental impacts, pilling issues, wide variation in quality.</li></ul><p>One yarn store may have dozens of yarns with different fiber contents, so pay close attention to the label, especially if you have allergies to any of the fibers present. Also, different fibers come with different care instructions.</p><h3>Yarn Weights</h3><p><img src=\"https://iloveyarnforever.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/yarn-weights-1024x750.jpg\" alt=\"Learn the best yarns for crochet beginners (and the worst!). Also learn about yarn construction, storage, and care. | TLYCBLog.com\"></p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://blog.lionbrand.com/fingering-sport-dk-worsted-bulky-what-does-yarn-weight-mean/\">Lion Brand</a></p><p>There are two kinds of weights associated with yarn. One weight is measured in grams and ounces. That speaks to how much the yarn in an individual skein/ball weights. <strong>The other kind of weight is how thick a single strand of yarn is. This weight is represented on a scale from 0 – lace weight to 7 – jumbo, placing every yarn into a category.</strong> Worsted and bulky weight yarns are considered the best yarns for crochet beginners because they fall right in the middle of the list.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/\">Craft Yarn Council</a> is a magnificent resource for understanding yarn weights and their associated hook recommendations. Their <a href=\"https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system\">handy guide</a> on yarn weights also explains the different names of each category. For example, category 4 – worsted weight is also sometimes called “medium” or “aran”.</p><h3>Yarn Put Up</h3><p><img src=\"https://s32071.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/Lisa_12_Yarn_Balls_800x400.jpg.webp\" alt=\"yarn ball types\"></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.interweave.com/article/knitting/lisas-list-yarn-ball-types/\">Interweave.com</a></p><p><strong>Yarn put up describes the way the yarn is presented for purchase.</strong> Most often you’ll find yarn in the store in bullet skeins, twisted hanks, pull skeins, and donut balls. More and more yarns are being found in cones again, especially cotton yarns.</p><p>We makers have some pretty bad habits when it comes to using the right terms for put ups (I, for one, still call bullet skeins balls – I just can’t stop!). For the most part, it doesn’t really matter what you call the put up, but it’s nice to know the correct terms.</p><h3>Yarn Plys</h3><p><img src=\"https://tlycblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1030-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Learn the best yarns for crochet beginners (and the worst!).

Often, multiple strands of yarn are twisted together, or </strong><i><strong>plied</strong></i><strong>, to create a single strand of commercial yarn.</strong> Single-ply yarn exists as well and is very popular.</p><p>The yarn manufacturing process is very complex. <strong>With so many companies making yarn, individual companies may get creative with the way the yarn is constructed</strong>. Wool yarns are sometimes blended with nylon to add strength, making them perfect for socks. Mohair and silk are often plied together for a hazy, luxuriously soft yarn. When shopping for yarn, take a close look at the yarn label to understand the fiber content, and don’t be afraid to pull the plies apart (<i>gently!</i>) to better inspect the yarn.</p><p>Yarn plies are used to describe how many individual strands are in the yarn, but you might also come across yarn plies being used to describe yarn weights (dk, worsted, etc.). Some countries, the UK and Australia especially, still do this.

Keep yarn in a cool, dry place. If you’re partial to cotton, try keeping it out of the sun so it does not fade. Bookshelves and storage containers are great places to keep yarn. Avoid keeping yarn in plastic bags – this can encourage yarn to retain moisture and mildew.</p><p><strong>One piece of information that you’ll find on 99% of yarn labels is care instructions. </strong>Some labels spell out the instructions in text, while others may have the instructions in symbols. <i>Not familiar with care symbols? Check out this post from the </i><a href=\"https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/care-symbols\"><i>Craft Yarn Council.</i></a></p><p><strong>Care instructions vary, mainly based on fiber.</strong> Here is a great rundown of care instructions by fiber from <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-care-for-crochet-blankets-2146311\">Spruce Crafts</a> via <a href=\"https://www.sigonimacaroni.com/yarn-types-explained-for-crochet-beginners-how-to-choose-the-right-yarn/\">SigoniMacaroni.com</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Superwash wool&nbsp;</strong>can be hand or machine washed on the gentle cycle in&nbsp;cold water.</li><li><strong>Regular wool&nbsp;</strong>must be washed by hand in cold water, or it will felt and shrink.</li><li><strong>Cotton, linen and ramie yarn&nbsp;</strong>can be washed in the washing machine&nbsp;on a gentle cycle&nbsp;using either cold or warm water.</li><li><strong>Acrylic and other synthetic yarns&nbsp;</strong>can be&nbsp;washed and dried in with your regular laundry&nbsp;as they do not shrink.</li><li><strong>Unknown fiber content items&nbsp;</strong>should be hand washed in cold water and laid flat to dry.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://tlycblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_5850-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Learn the best yarns for crochet beginners (and the worst!).

I like to go for a sage gree 100% superwash merino wool, as it has great stitch definition, it’s easy to see your stitches, and the yarn is very smooth.</p><p><strong>What weight of yarn is best for crochet blankets?</strong></p><p><strong>If you are a beginner crocheter, I recommend going with a category 4 – worsted or category 5 – bulky weight yarn to make blankets. </strong>Yarns like these are easy to find in the store and online, and they are easy to handle. Bulky weight yarns also work up very quickly so you can complete a blanket from start to finish in a weekend. If you are feeling more adventurous, try making a delicate blanket from fingering weight yarn, or a super cozy blanket from jumbo weight yarn.</p><p><strong>What is the best quality acrylic yarn?</strong></p><p>Acrylic yarn has come a long way. <strong>These days, you can easily find high-quality, luxuriously soft acrylic yarn in craft stores and online. </strong>Some recommendations to try would be We Crochet’s <a href=\"https://shrsl.com/2888d\">Brava</a>, Lion Brand’s <a href=\"https://shrsl.com/2n3fl\">Wool-Ease Thick &amp; Quick</a>, and Berrocco’s <a href=\"http://lionbrand.com/\">Comfort</a>.</p><p><strong>Can you use crochet yarn for knitting?</strong></p><p><strong>Technically, there’s no such thing as “crochet yarn”. </strong>The term crochet yarn is typically used to describe very fine cotton thread, mainly used by crocheters to make blankets and other heirloom projects. This yarn can be knitted, crocheted, and applied to any number of yarn and craft projects.</p><p><strong>Is acrylic yarn safe?</strong></p><p>Acrylic yarn is a synthetic, man-made material.<strong> While acrylic yarn is praised for its versatility, accessibility, and value, there is a downside to this popular fiber.</strong> Acrylic yarn is flammable and melts into plastic. This may give you pause when gifting items made for babies. Acrylic is also produced with harsh chemicals that can have an impact on our health and our environment.

(22, 2, '2022-04-11 22:30:26', '5 Top-Down Sweater Styles Explained', '<p>Whenever I have <a href=\"https://www.interweave.com/product-category/knitting/\">knitting</a> construction questions, I can always count on one person to have the answers—<a href=\"http://www.annbuddknits.com/\">Ann Budd</a>. With more than a dozen books under her belt (or I should say, in her knitting bag), she truly has become the knitting community’s how-to guru. Whether I’m interested in socks, scarves, or sweaters, she’s written about them all.</p><p>Today I’m interested in sweaters and sleeves. So, I’m turning to Ann’s best-selling book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rOHTjF\"><i>The Knitter’s Handy Book of Top-Down Sweaters</i></a> (affiliate link). I’ve read that <a href=\"https://www.interweave.com/article/knitting/lisas-list-6-types-of-sweater-armholes/\">different style armholes</a>&nbsp;might better flatter my body type (or yours) than the usual raglans I knit. However, before casting-on a new project, I like having a clear understanding of how the knitting process will go. Ann’s book does a fantastic job outlining the basic knitting process of 5 different top-down sweater styles. Plus, she shares the unique canvases these styles create at the neckline.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SweaterStyles-1024x512.jpg.webp\" alt=\"top-down sweater\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SweaterStyles-1024x512.jpg.webp 1024w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SweaterStyles-400x200.jpg.webp 400w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SweaterStyles-768x384.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SweaterStyles.jpg.webp 1220w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"640\"></figure><p><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SeamlessYoke.jpg.webp\" alt=\"top-down sweater\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SeamlessYoke.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SeamlessYoke-400x258.jpg.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\"></p><h2><strong>1. Seamless Yoke</strong></h2><p>The seamless yoke style is the simplest top-down sweater to knit in the round. Stitches are cast on for the neck circumference, then increased evenly spaced in four intervals to the widest circumference at the armhole depth. During the yoke, there is no definition between the front(s), back, and sleeves. When the yoke measures the desired depth, stitches for the sleeves are placed on holders. Then the front(s) and back are joined and worked in 1 piece to the bind-off at the lower edge. The held sleeve stitches are then worked in the round to the cuffs.</p><p>Seamless yoke sweaters are unique in their lack of visible armhole shaping. The yoke is shaped with increases that are evenly distributed around the entire circumference of the upper body. Depending on the type of increases used, the shaping can be decorative or quite inconspicuous. Keep in mind that, because the shoulders and armholes are not well defined, the yokes of these sweaters have a less tailored fit than raglan or set-in sleeve silhouettes. But you can get a trim fit if you add waist shaping. The lack of shaping definition at the yoke results in an uninterrupted canvas for color or texture patterns.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/Raglans.jpg.webp\" alt=\"https://www.interweave.com/store/the-knitters-handy-book-of-top-down-sweater-patterns\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/Raglans.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/Raglans-400x267.jpg.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\"></p><h2><strong>2. Raglan</strong></h2><p>The next simplest style is the raglan. It differs from the seamless yoke in that the yoke increases are clustered along four distinct lines (two each on the front and back) that emphasize the boundaries between the front(s), back, and sleeves. Like the seamless yoke style, the raglan yoke is increased to the widest circumference at the armhole depth, and then stitches for the sleeves are placed on holders and the front(s) and back are worked in one piece to the bind-off at the lower edge. The held sleeve stitches are then worked in the round to the cuffs.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>WHY FRONT(S)?</strong> Putting an S in parenthesis after front is not a typo on our part. Sweaters that might have more than one front are cardigans!</i></p></blockquote><p>Sweaters with raglan shaping have distinctive “seams” between the front(s), back, and sleeves that form diagonal lines running from the neck edge to the base of the armholes. Beginning at the neck, the number of stitches on the front(s), back, and sleeves increase at regular intervals along these lines. This gives each section a triangular shape. The raglan lines can be decorative or inconspicuous, depending on the type and sequence of increases used. Raglan sweaters fit nicely at the shoulders and lend themselves well to a close fit or waist shaping. The raglan lines provide a nice structure for textural design elements, too.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/ModDropShoulder.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/ModDropShoulder.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/ModDropShoulder-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/ModDropShoulder-400x400.jpg.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\"></p><h2><strong>3. Modified Drop-Shoulder</strong></h2><p>For the modified drop-shoulder style, the sleeves join the yoke in “notches” that extend from the shoulders to the base of the armholes. Other than stitches cast on at the base of the armholes, there is no armhole shaping. The front(s) and back are worked separately to the desired armhole depth. Then, 1″ to 2″ (2.5 to 5 cm) of stitches are cast on to add body width at the under¬arm when the pieces are joined for working simultaneously to the lower edge. Beginning and ending at the center of the underarm, stitches are picked up around the armhole opening for the sleeves. Short-rows combined with decreases at the base of the armhole are worked to fill in the notches formed by the additional underarm stitches, then the sleeves are worked in the round to the cuffs.</p><p>Modified drop-shoulder (also called indented sleeve or square armhole) sweaters are characterized by a boxy shape and casual style. The sleeves are attached to the body along straight armhole edges indented up to 3″ (7.5 cm) from the full body width. The resulting square shape provides a broad canvas on which it’s easy to incorporate texture patterns. Simple knit-<a href=\"https://www.interweave.com/glossary/purl-stitch/\">purl stitch</a> patterns can fill the wide expanse of the drop-shoulder silhouette.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SetInSleeve.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SetInSleeve.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SetInSleeve-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SetInSleeve-400x400.jpg.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\"></p><h2><strong>4. Set-In Sleeve</strong></h2><p>Set-in sleeve styles have a classic tailored fit. The front(s) and back are worked separately to the desired armhole depth, with increases worked along the edges to tailor the shape of the armholes. Like the modified drop-shoulder style, a couple of inches of stitches are cast on to add body width at the underarm when the pieces are joined for working simultaneously to the lower edge. Beginning and ending at the center of the underarm, stitches are picked up around the armhole opening for each sleeve. The cap is shaped with short-rows that are centered over the shoulder to smoothly fill in the armhole opening. At the base of the armhole, the stitches are joined and worked in the round to the cuffs.</p><p>Sweaters with set-in sleeves have tailored silhouettes and a timeless, classic quality. Because there is no excess fabric at the armholes, it gives a more refined look to even casual styles. The set-in style is particularly well-suited for close-fitting variations that can be enhanced through hourglass waist shaping. The sleeve cap is shaped with short-rows to form a somewhat visible line along the armhole join. It also differs more from its bottom-up counterpart than the other top-down styles in this book. However, this method eliminates the need for armhole seams and combines the refined set-in silhouette with the convenience of top-down construction.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SaddleShoulder.jpg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SaddleShoulder.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SaddleShoulder-150x150.jpg.webp 150w, https://www.interweave.com/wp-content/uploads/SaddleShoulder-400x400.jpg.webp 400w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"600\"></p><h2><strong>5. Saddle-Shoulder</strong></h2><p>The saddle-shoulder style in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rOHTjF\"><i>The Knitter’s Handy Book of Top-Down Sweaters</i></a> (affiliate link) is closely related to the set-in sleeve style. The difference between the two lies in the “saddle,” a rectangle of fabric worked at the top of the shoulder that extends into the sleeve cap. For this style, the saddle is worked first, then stitches for the front(s) and back are picked up from the edges of the saddles and worked downward to the base of the armholes, which are shaped the same as set-in sleeves. The sleeves are also worked the same, but the held saddle stitches are incorporated into the stitches picked up along the front and back armhole edges.</p><p>Saddle-shoulder sweaters, named for the extensions of the sleeves (also called saddles or sleeve straps) that extend from the neck to the tops of the sleeve caps, have a classic fit. Like sweaters with set-in sleeves, saddle-shoulder sweaters have no excess fabric at the armholes and therefore have a clean, tailored silhouette that is well suited for close-fitting variations. Most importantly, the shoulder straps provide a prominent area in which to showcase a design element.</p>', 'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1063/8274/files/bleideag_yoke-2_2048x2048.jpg?v=1573069213', 1, 1, 0, 9),
(23, 9, '2022-04-11 22:45:32', 'Yarn Types (Everything You Need To Know!)', '<p>In this post, you will learn about different <strong>yarn types.</strong></p><p>The first time you enter a yarn shop can be a daunting experience – there are so many different types of yarn and so many colours to choose from!</p><p>And shopping online for knitting yarn can be equally as confusing, especially for a beginner.</p><p>What’s the difference between a worsted weight and DK yarn? Aran or Afghan? Super Bulky or Sport?</p><p>To make things a bit clearer, this article sets out the different types of yarns available and helps you choose the right ball (or skein) of yarn for your beginner knitting project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Yarn-types.jpg\" alt=\"white yarn types\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>The Different Yarn Weights</strong></i></h2><p>First of all, it’s essential to understand the various types of yarn weights.</p><p>Weights of yarn are separated by the thickness of the yarn, or ‘ply’.</p><p>Below is a useful, quick list of all available yarns and their characteristics, in order of chunky (top) to thin (bottom):</p><ul><li><strong>Super Bulky or Super Chunky</strong><ul><li>Commonly used for heavy blankets and rugs, or chunky pullovers</li></ul></li><li><strong>Aran or Afghan</strong><ul><li>Used for scarves, hats, garments such as jumpers and cardigans.</li><li>Cozy clothing that will keep you warm.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Worsted Weight or DK (double knitting yarn)</strong><ul><li>Found in patterns for garments such as jumpers or cardigans, hats, accessories.</li><li>Generally, items of clothing that will keep you warm.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sport</strong><ul><li>Commonly used in knitting and crochet patterns for light sweaters, scarves and accessories, and some baby items.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Baby</strong><ul><li>Baby yarn is used for lightweight clothing, perfect for baby.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fingering or Super Fine Weight</strong><ul><li>An ultra-fine yarn that is slightly trickier to use.</li><li>Commonly used in more decorative throws and accessories, often with more complex stitches.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Thread or Lace Weight Yarn</strong><ul><li>Often found in complex patterns, the thread can be used to make lace items.</li><li>These are often complex and usually found in advanced crochet patterns.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><i><strong>Learn More About Yarn Weights</strong></i></h2><p>As a beginner, you should be looking to use any yarn within the range of super bulky to DK, as these yarns are thicker and will allow you to see your stitches more easily.</p><p>Thicker yarns are also more comfortable to move in your hands with a greater purchase than a thin yarn, giving you more control over your work.</p><p>Yarns that I would suggest avoiding would be fingering yarns or thread, as these can prove too intricate for anyone new to the craft of knitting or crochet, as it is very difficult to see the separate stitches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/knitting-with-white-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"knitting with white yarn\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Yarn Fibers And Composition</strong></i></h2><p>There are many different types of fibres to choose from, including wool, acrylic, cotton, merino, cashmere, alpaca, and a blend of these.</p><p>For beginners, I would recommend starting with a natural woollen yarn, or wool blend yarn.</p><p>This fibre is incredibly versatile and easy to work with, and overall has slightly more stretch than yarns such as cotton or acrylic.&nbsp;</p><p>Wool blend yarns are also relatively cost-effective, making them an economical choice for trying out new projects.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> choose a contrasting colour to the shade of your knitting needles – it will make it easier for you to distinguish between knitting needles and your work!</p><p>A variegated yarn is also great for new knitters, as you can see your stitches more distinctly with the changes in colour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/green-yarn-cakes.jpg\" alt=\"green yarn cakes\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Acrylic</strong></h3><p>Acrylic is used by many makers as it is cheap, comes in a variety of colours and is widely available.</p><p>Acrylic is not as breathable or as absorbent as wool, but it’s machine washable and tough.</p><p>Pure acrylic yarn is normally used for homewares, baby clothes and blankets.</p><p>If you are on a tight budget, this is a great yarn to use as it can start from $2 per 100g ball.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Acrylic-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Acrylic yarn\"></figure><p><a

Yarns</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Blended</strong></h3><p>Blended yarns are also really popular with makers.</p><p>Different types of fibres are mixed together to create yarns that combine both wool and acrylic.</p><p>Unusual yarns are also created when fibres are mixed as synthetic fibres are used to bind ‘feature’ items like sequins to a main strand of yarn.</p><p>Synthetic fibres can be much cheaper than animal or plant fibres.</p><p>If you want to work with a fibre that is fairly cost-effective then look for wool, cashmere or silk with an acrylic, viscose or nylon mix.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Blended-Yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Blended Yarn\"></figure><p><a

Acrylic/20% Wool</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Cotton</strong></h3><p>This is a classic summer yarn – cotton can also be great for those who are allergic to animal fibres.</p><p>Cotton has little elasticity but is very strong and has beautiful colours available.</p><p>If you are knitting something in cotton you don’t need to fully soak it to block it when you are finished.</p><p>You can just lie it flat on an ironing board or clean sheet and give it a good blast of steam from your iron.</p><p>Crisp and cool, cotton is perfect for summer garments.</p><p>Lightweight cotton is also a great choice for tops and cardigans.</p><p>But if you want to use it for wraps and shawls, consider using a cotton/wool blend to stop it from stretching too much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Cotton-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Cotton yarn\"></figure><p><a

Cotton</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Linen</strong></h3><p>One of the first fibres ever spun, linen flax comes from plants.</p><p>It is very strong and light but has a tendency to crease in woven fabric.</p><p>Like wool, linen is highly absorbent and suitable for warm and cold weather.</p><p>Unlike cotton, linen isn’t prone to stretching and tends to soften when washing.</p><p>This yarn is not so great for cables but great for lace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Linen-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Linen yarn\"></figure><p><a

100%</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Wool</strong></h3><p>Wool is breathable and highly absorbent, it is long-lasting and softens with wear.</p><p>It also requires less washing than other fibres.</p><p>Use superwash yarn is you want to machine wash it though, as otherwise, it can felt!</p><p>If you wet it and stretch it out when blocking, it will keep the shape it dries into.</p><p>Choose wool for blankets, Aran sweaters and close-fitting tops.</p><p>Some people find wool a little itchy, so before making a garment, wear a little strand around your neck and see if it irritates you.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Wool.jpg\" alt=\"Wool\"></figure><p><a

Wool</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Alpaca</strong></h3><p>Alpaca is incredibly soft and has a luxurious feel to it.</p><p>Thanks to its hollow fibres, which act as mini insulating rods, it’s very warm making it perfect for winter accessories.</p><p>Using an alpaca blend for a garment is a good idea, as wearing anything in 100% alpaca will be very hot.</p><p>Unlike wool which has a natural elasticity, alpaca can ‘grow’ over time.</p><p>So it’s better to make garments in pieces rather than seamlessly, as the structure added by seams helps to prevent your sweater from stretching.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Alpaca-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Alpaca yarn\"></figure><p><a

Alpaca</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Mohair</strong></h3><p>Mohair is popular and is normally blended with silk or nylon to create a strong fluffy yarn that can be dyed in many colours.</p><p>Mohair can be itchy if used for a whole garment, so it’s best to try it out against your skin first.</p><p>Held double, a very fine laceweight mohair mix yarn can create a warm, soft fabric that adds something special to the look of a piece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/mohair-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"mohair yarn\"></figure><p><a

Haze</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Cashmere</strong></h3><p>Very light and warm, cashmere is combed from the stomachs of mountain goats and is very expensive.</p><p>It’s the best choice out there for quality.</p><p>Many yarns include a touch of cashmere for softness, but few contain large quantities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Cashmere-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Cashmere yarn\"></figure><p><a

Fine</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Silk</strong></h3><p>Silk is a favourite with knitters who like to make lacy items in superfine yarns.</p><p>Silk comes in many vibrant colours.</p><p>As well as pure silk yarns, alpaca yarns and wool/silk mixes are popular choices for shawls and scarves.</p><p>Silk is a great choice for light draping garments and will give your project an amazing stitch definition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/Silk-yarn.jpg\" alt=\"Silk yarn\"></figure><p><strong>Silk Yarn – Berroco Mantra – 100% Silk</strong></p><h2><i><strong>Tools To Use With Yarn For Beginners</strong></i></h2><p>If you are just starting out, I recommend opting for bamboo needles over metal or plastic.</p><p>Lightweight bamboo needles very lightweight and easy to move in your hands, making them a good choice for beginners learning to knit.</p><p>Many knitters also recommend using a stitch counter when working, to make it easier for them to keep track of the number of stitches needed.</p><p>Once you’ve mastered basic stitches and you’ve started making larger patterns, it’s also a good idea to invest in a lightweight bamboo crochet hook, so that you can cast off neatly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.handylittleme.com/wp-content/uploads/white-yarn-and-needles.jpg\" alt=\"white yarn and needles\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Knitting Patterns for Beginners</strong></i></h2><p>The best way to find out which yarns you are most comfortable using is to try out some basic patterns and get used to holding the yarn in your hands.</p><p>What feels natural to one person might not work for another, so I recommend picking up your knitting needles or crochet hook with a new ball of yarn and seeing what you can create.</p>', 'https://www.julie-asselin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/275077701_4988211797892219_1347411842039238860_n-500x500.jpeg', 1, 1, 0,

It’s a group of yarn crafters who get together every week to knit and crochet and show off their projects (finished and work-in-progress).</p><h2><i>Why should I join?</i></h2><p>There are so many&nbsp;reasons!&nbsp;It’s a fun way to meet new friends who also enjoy crocheting, and who appreciate the time and effort that go into handmade items.</p><p>The members in my local group sometimes bring in things to swap or give away, including yarn from their stash, patterns, knit or crochet magazines, notions, and even finished objects that they made.</p><p>Another great&nbsp;benefit of attending these groups that I’ve personally experienced is that it’s helped me&nbsp;complete all those UFOs (unfinished objects) I’ve had lying around. I’ve since finished two blankets so far by working on them during these group meets.</p><p>Time flies when you’re having fun, and I’m able to make short work of otherwise big, tedious projects. &nbsp;I’m so productive there, that I’ve been searching for big projects to begin so that I have something to work on there!</p><p>It’s a great place to share what you’ve learned, and learn from others. I’ve taught a few beginner crocheters here and there, and I’ve also received help with knitting. Sometimes, having someone show you a technique in person is a lot easier than figuring it out on your own with Youtube videos!</p><p>I’ve also met all sorts of wonderful and fascinating people. I’ve met many knitters&nbsp;who have enthusiastically volunteered to help me learn to knit. Some of our regular members include a former owner of local yarn store, who still has quite a bit of her stock (including rare yarns and unique notions) that she regularly brings in to give away, or to sell at a steeply discounted or wholesale&nbsp;price. I’ve also met pattern designers and online craft store owners.&nbsp;I met a crocheter who sells her crocheted items at craft fairs. She generously offered to bring some of my crocheted items along with her to sell for me!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2021/03/16/NRRS/327bca5a-607f-4763-a923-622705e1e7cf-ILROC-031821-PHOTO-CrochetClub01.JPG\" alt=\"Lewis Lemon Elementary School has a new crochet club for girls\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.rrstar.com/story/news/2021/03/21/lewis-lemon-elementary-school-has-new-crochet-club-girls/4644690001/\">Photo Credit</a></p><h2><i>How can I find crochet groups near me?</i></h2><h3><i>1.&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\"><i>Meetup.com</i></a></h3><p>Depending on where you live, you may be able to find a crochet group using <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">meetup.com</a>, especially if you live near a city or a more populated area. I’d suggest searching for a knitting group even if you don’t knit, because sometimes those groups started off as a knitting group, but changed into a yarn-craft group to include crocheters.</p><h3><i>2. Contact your local libraries</i></h3><p>This is how I ended up finding out about the 3 groups I’m a part of. Take a look at their events calendar, which may be listed online, or posted in the library. If you can’t find anything, call up your local branches and your main branch, and ask directly. Sometimes, these groups just aren’t listed!</p><p>My local library didn’t have a group listed on their online events calendar (which was populated with all sorts of other recurring events). It turns out, they did have a knitting and crochet group that met there weekly for 9 years. It just wasn’t listed online for some reason.</p><p>I only found out because I was told by a few of their members, who&nbsp;happened to also attend the other groups I was in, at farther libraries. Funny enough, when I first moved here, I had scoured that library’s website, and went into the library in person specifically looking to find out if such a group existed. I didn’t see any flyers advertising it, so I figured it didn’t exist. But I was wrong – and I would’ve found out if I had asked directly!</p><h3><i>3. Check your local yarn stores</i></h3><p>Some local yarn stores have an area set aside specifically for people to come in and crochet with others. Just note that I’ve heard that sometimes, local yarn stores may ask that in return to hosting these get-togethers, you support their business by working with yarns brands that they carry in their store, or by purchasing coffee or a snack there.</p><p>A couple of my crochet groups started out this way – as customers befriending each other, and regularly meeting in the store to crochet or knit as a group. When the yarn store closed, they found a new location to meet and continued there. One of these groups, with over a hundred members, has been meeting for about 12 years,&nbsp;and usually has about 20-30 people show up at the weekly meet!</p><h3><i>4. Look on Ravelry</i></h3><p><a href=\"http://www.ravelry.com/groups\">Ravelry.com/groups</a>&nbsp;may have a group for your town! You can search for your town or state name, and check their forum for existing get-togethers, or see if there are people in your area looking to form one.</p><p>Just note that a group that actively meets in person may have an inactive forum, so if you encounter what looks to be a dead forum, don’t just assume that they’re no longer getting together! Of my groups, the biggest and most active one meets every week, but there hasn’t been a forum post in our Ravelry group for over 2 years!</p><p>If your town doesn’t have a group yet, why not start your own? There may be other crafters in your area who are also searching for a get-together.</p><h3><i>5. Look on various crochet forums</i></h3><p>In addition to Ravelry, you can also check on crochet forums, including <a href=\"http://www.crochetville.com/community/\">Crochetville</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://crochettalk.com/\">CrochetTalk</a>. There may already be a group in your area that was mentioned there, or you may find posts by crafters in your town looking to make a group.</p><h3><i>6. Check on Lion Brand’s Directory of Clubs</i></h3><p>Lion Brand has a <a href=\"http://www.lionbrand.com/blog/want-to-find-a-knit-or-crochet-group-in-your-area-our-search-tool-can-help-you/\">Directory of Knitting and Crochet Clubs</a>. Just note that if you don’t get any results, that doesn’t mean no groups exist near you.&nbsp;I checked with my zip code, and three of the local yarn craft groups I attend&nbsp;weren’t listed.</p><h3><i>&nbsp;7. For students: check your school’s club list</i></h3><p>If you’re a student, your school may already have an existing crochet, knit, or general craft club. If not, why not start&nbsp;one? There may be other crocheters in your school, and if not, there may be people who are interested in learning!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you part of a crochet group or club?
