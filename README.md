# Yarn Corner

A locally hosted, knit & crochet-themed blogging platform

Using: PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Chart.js, DataTables, and CKEditor

## How to use
Download all files, make sure to upload the geary.sql file to your personal myphpadmin if you intend to open it on your own machine, and modify the required/conn.php file accordingly.

## Features
To explore all the little things I worked into the project, here's a list of some features

### Register, Login
Steer your attention to the "Log In" button on the left bar. You can log in as an admin with "admin" for both username & password, or create your own account using the "Don't have an account?" button (and follow the registration instructions), or return to the main blog page.

### Main Page
On the main page, select a category on the left bar or use the search bar to find specific posts. Alternatively, click an author's profile to view their page, which will show that author's other posts. Click on posts to view them in full, and scroll down to the bottom to post a comment if you'd like (but you must be logged in to do so!). 

If you're logged in, you'll see a "My Profile and Blogs" option on the left bar, that's where you can upload a bio, add socials, write a post, reset your password, change your email, etc.

Once you've authored a blog, you may notice that on that blog page, you have the option to edit your writing. Try it out!

### Admin
Now for the fun stuff!! Log in using "admin" for both your username and password, and go to the admin page on the left bar.

The dashboard should pop up with some basic analytics (views by category, posts by category). Then from here, you can go to the admin tables in the left bar to check out the posts, categories, users, and comments. There'll be a pile of bug testing posts you can mess around with if you'd like. For posts, you can toggle the feature and publish status, edit the title, categories, leading image, and content of the post. You can make new categories and toggle the visibility of existing ones, toggle the publish status and content of comments, and make edits to user profiles.


I think that's it for features, but I'll update if I come up with any more!

## Disclaimer
Just wanted to leave a little note, this is pre-university code and it's very poorly documented and messy at times. I'm working away at cleaning it all up in my free time, but for the record, my newer code is *much* cleaner!
